You will need to use this budget carefully as you try to reduce those emissions over the next 10 years, bearing in mind that the budget may be subject to increases based on performance. To do so, you will need
to make strategic financial decisions in response to key climate change risks and opportunities, as well as certain business imperatives.

surpass 2°C of warming, despite new government regulations and
commitments from large companies.

Sea Share has felt the consequences of climate change in its operations, with a 10% increase in weather-related disruptions over the past two years. The message from the board of directors is clear: Stick to the net zero target, but maintain conservative financial oversight!</div>

		<div>Do nothing and accept the possibility of disrupted operations in these ports, as well as the associated emissions from baseline operations, while work is curtailed.</div>
		<div>A month of severe heat has hit port facilities in Northern Europe for the third time in three years. Under EU law, workers in those ports must have their working hours reduced and have access to cooled facilities to prevent heat exhaustion.</div>
		<div>Invest in robotic systems for affected ports. Such systems can function alongside port workers at all times (thereby increasing efficiency) and replace them during heat waves (ensuring work can continue).</div>
		<div>$0</div>
		<div>Invest in cooling systems to maintain productivity at the ports during heat waves. While this would save some emissions by maintaining efficient operations, it would also create emissions from increased electricity usage.</div>

		<div>Severe weather events</div>
		<div>Sea Share is looking at several options to meet these requirements. Some have implications for emissions and must therefore come from your climate budget.</div>
		<div>One of Sea Share’s major North American ports is expected to be hit by an increasing number of hurricanes. The company has done business in this port for over 20 years, but has recently been in discussions with the main exporting companies about shifting operations to a port 200 miles away.

The alternative port has greater resilience to hurricanes in the region and a move promises marginal improvements in emissions (due to fewer disruptions). However, shifting ports would mean greater emissions from customers moving materials, increasing scope 3 emissions.</div>
		<div>Do nothing and risk future hurricane disruptions, as well as their inevitable associated costs.</div>

		<div>Sustainable diesel: This is derived from petroleum, like any other diesel fuel, but the extraction, transport, and refining is conducted by operations that are certified to have lower emissions and improved efficiency.</div>
		<div>$10,000,000</div>
		<div>Fuel technologies have progressed substantially in the last few years and a variety of options are now emerging. Two alternatives to diesel fuel look particularly promising and would substantially reduce carbon emissions.

While each of these fuel types has the potential to break even on costs over time, heavy initial investment is needed to bring either one to scale in the short term. Fortunately, both options are compatible with the company’s current engines.</div>

		<div>In the past four years, more and more companies have begun to publicly declare their net-zero commitments. While this pressures Sea Share to maintain its commitments, it also supports partnerships toward climate goals, particularly in relation to scope

and out of port facilities.</div>

		<div>Join the initiative as a full member
and push for the most aggressive infrastructure upgrades that include measures to reduce congestion and improve resilience to prevent longer shut-down of port activities in the face of probable future weather disruptions.</div>
		<div>Port traffic continues to be a challenge: Infrastructure is aging and, in many markets, unable to handle increased shipping volumes. This leads to frequent traffic jams, where idling engines increase emissions, and raises energy demand to store temperature-sensitive materials at ports and on ships waiting off-shore.

A number of the company’s larger port partners have proposed a new “Sustainable Ports Initiative” that focuses on infrastructure improvements to reduce congestion. Joining entails shared investment with the ports, governments, other shipping companies, and on-shore terminals.</div>
		<div>Join the initiative as a contributing member with no voting rights.
The group then pushes for infrastructure upgrades to reduce congestion, but not to improve resilience, resulting in some (but not all) potential emissions reductions.</div>

		<div>Integrating business and climate strategies</div>
		<div>The effects of climate change continue to disrupt.</div>
		<div>You have been COO for six years.
The natural world continues to transform as a result of climate change, as do business operations.

It is becoming increasingly clear that the company’s infrastructure network is threatened, particularly in emerging markets. The business is changing as a result and executive leadership must make tough decisions on where the business should operate, considering the implications on both its bottom line and its net-zero commitments.

In the next two years, you will need
to prove you can reduce emissions without blowing your budget, as executive leadership is concerned about how much the net-zero target costs the company.</div>

		<div>The market is shifting. No sector demonstrates this more than energy: Customer demand for liquefied
natural gas (LNG) is increasing each year as gas prices drop, and the world sees it as a transition fuel to a lower carbon economy.

But LNG requires enormous amounts of energy to cool and ship. Sea Share
is considering different ways to expand its shipping fleet to include LNG ships.</div>

You are encouraged to try again.
But this time, think about the fact that the largest opportunities for reducing emissions occur early on in your journey. Consider the “low-hanging fruit” of scope 1 emissions reduction, and bear in mind that a ton of CO₂e saved early on has a bigger long-term impact on climate change than that same ton saved later on.
