		<div>Hacktivist groups</div>
		<div>Anonymous hackers that unite around a shared cause — mostly political, but also cultural, patriotic, and religious — and use their skills
to support it. Hacktivism involves the nonviolent use of illegal — or legally ambiguous — digital tools. The most (in)famous hacktivist group is Anonymous, which focuses its
attacks on political figures, foreign governments, and religious groups.</div>
		<div>Organized crime groups</div>
		<div>In the past, cybercrime was thought
of as a one-man activity; these days the underground is buzzing with organized crime groups. Criminal groups who engage in organized cybercrime usually make use of a variety of methods and threats — hacking, malware creation and distribution, DDoS attacks, social engineering — to inflict harm on their victims. With such a myriad of threats and methods at their disposal, organized crime groups can cause financial, psychological, and economic harm. The main motivation behind the attacks launched by these groups is financial gain.</div>
		<div>Malicious insiders</div>
		<div>These threat actors target organizations or systems they already have access to. They are usually individuals who intentionally abuse credentials to perform information theft for personal or financial motives. It is also common for these threat actors to leak inside information to the outside world and, in doing so, negatively impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an organization’s information or information systems. An infamous example of a malicious insider is the case of Jean Patrice Delia, a previous employee of General Electric, who stole 8,000 sensitive files from the company with the goal of starting a new competing company.</div>
		<div>Advanced technologies are being used in espionage between nation states. Government-sponsored cyberespionage groups target and gain illicit access
to other government networks in order to listen in on conversations as well
as steal and damage confidential information.</div>

		<div>Probability Strategies</div>
		<div>Simple Random Sampling
</div>
		<div>This requires a complete and accurate list of the population, which might not always be available or feasible to create.
</div>
		<div>When to use:
</div>
		<div>When you require a statistically representative sample of the population and every member of the population has a known chance of being selected.
</div>
		<div>Things to consider:
</div>
		<div>When you can easily divide your population into distinct groups or clusters.
</div>
		<div>Cluster Sampling
</div>
		<div>There is the risk of high sampling error if clusters are not homogeneous.
</div>
		<div>Be cautious as it can introduce bias if there's a pattern in the population that coincides with the sampling interval.
</div>
		<div>When you have a structured and ordered population, as it involves selection at regular intervals.
</div>
		<div>Systematic Sampling
</div>
		<div>This requires a good understanding and thorough knowledge of the population structure to correctly from the strata.
</div>
		<div>Stratified Random Sampling
</div>
		<div>When your population is heterogeneous and can be divided into distinct strataor categories.
</div>
		<div>Money</div>
		<div>Many threat actors employ cyberthreats to cause damage and ultimately demand ransom to perform damage control and restore networks and systems. Threat actors such as organized crime groups are a good example of this. In these cases, ransomware is the go-to threat
type as criminals can encrypt an organization’s critical files and
demand ransom in order to decrypt them. These days cybercriminals demand cryptocurrencies as it is
often untraceable.</div>
		<div>Valuable data</div>
		<div>Valuable or sensitive data, such as bank account details, passwords, telephone numbers, etc., is targeted by most cybercriminals as it serves multiple functions. It can be sold on the black market, it can be used to gain further access into other systems or networks, or it can be leaked, thereby damaging the organization’s reputation.</div>
		<div>Reputation or brand</div>
		<div>Most cyberattacks have the ability
to damage the reputation or brand
of an organization as it jeopardizes customer trust as well as its industry perception. Hacktivist groups are most likely to target this core asset as their main focus is not the money they can make out of an attack but rather the harm they can inflict on an organization that does not share their views.</div>
		<div>An organization’s intellectual property (IP) — be it patents, trade secrets, or employee know-how —
is sometimes more valuable than its physical assets, which is why cybercriminals target this core asset. Once threat actors gain access to an organization’s IP, they can use it for financial gain or even reputational damage. Experts claim that this asset has increased in value in the past two decades and it is imperative for organizations to acknowledge this and put systems in place to protect it.</div>

		<div>Birth Order andAcademic Performance</div>
		<div>To study the correlation between social class and academic achievement, Mr. Garcia separates the students into different strata based on their family income. He then uses a random sampling technique within each stratum to ensure a representative sample.
</div>
		<div>Incorrect!</div>
		<div>To understand the impact of the school environment on students' performance, Mr. Rogers, a school counselor, decides to select a few classes at random and survey all the students within those selected classes.
</div>
		<div>Simple random sampling: Well-suited to non-diverse or equally dispersed population groups.
Cluster sampling: Works best in scenarios with easily identifiable, distinct subgroups or clusters.

Systematic sampling: Ideally used within well-structured populations.

Stratified random sampling: Requires good knowledge of a heterogeneous population that can be divided along a range of distinct categories.

		<div>Mrs. Patterson, the school counselor, is conducting a study on student stress levels across the school. She wants to ensure every student has an equal chance of being selected.
</div>
		<div>Student Performanceand Environment</div>
		<div>Simple random sampling: Great for drawing a sample equally from across the population without prioritizing any distinct groups.
Cluster sampling: Used to randomly select groups within the population rather than individuals. 

Systematic sampling: Works well with an ordered population where the ordering is unrelated to the variable being studied. 

Stratified random sampling: An effective sampling strategy for cases where a particular identifiable variable is being studied.

		<div>To understand the cultural influences on students' academic aspirations, Mrs. Mitchell divides students into different groups based on their cultural backgrounds. She then selects an equal number of students from each group, ensuring representation of all cultural groups in her research.
</div>
		<div>Convenience sampling: Best used in scenarios with time and resource pressures. 
Purposive sampling: Best used when focusing on a specific, relevant, target population.

Snowball sampling: Leverages in-group knowledge of individuals with specific traits that may be hard to discover.

Quota sampling: Focuses on equal representation of all relevant population segments over more generalizable random selection.
